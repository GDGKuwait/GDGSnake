# GCSnake
### A snake game build with Game Closure SDK
Version 0.2.2

## Overview

[Game Closure SDK](http://gameclosure.com) is a very promising HTML5 game development framework laucnhed to the public around Feb. 2013. To play with this new SDK, I wrote a snake game, which gradually evolved in order to be part of presentation about Game Closure.

This game doesn't really focus on the indepth capabilities of the SDK as much as getting the feel of writing classes and passing data around. 

## Setup:

If you haven't already, go grab your copy of the [Game Closure SDK](http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/install.html), install it, and make sure that it's working by running `basil serve`.

#### Steps:
+ Download/Clone the GCSnake project form GitHub.
+ Move the project within the devkit directory, if it is outside.
+ In terminal, navigate to the game's directory and execute `basil register` to add the game to your registry.
+ Run the game as you would with all other games you created using Game Closure.
